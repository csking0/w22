## Instructions for the exam 

* You may bring one 8.5" x 11" piece of paper with notes on both sides. This paper will be collected along with your exam, so make your own copy if you would like to keep it.
* No calculators or phones are allowed in the exam  
* There are no makeups for this exam
* You must write your name on every single sheet of paper including your notes
* We will provide you with scratch paper


## Past exams
You may also refer to all the past exams. Please note that some questions on these exams may refer to labs that you have not completed so far. You will only be asked questions related to the labs you have completed. The past exams should however provide some information on the expected difficulty and approximate format of the exam. Please note that there may be differences in content as well.

Please note that these old exams are provided "as is"; I cannot commit to providing answer keys for any of them, much less all of them.
