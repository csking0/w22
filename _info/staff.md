* Email: Please use Campuswire rather than email for course related communication.  You can send private messages on Campuswire to either the entire course staff or directly to me. If you must email me using my email address (zdeng@ucsb.edu), please put `CS16` in the subject line, and know that there may be a delay in the response.

## Learning Assistants (LAs)
In addition to the instructor and TA, there will be some undergraduate Learning Assistants (LAs) in the course who are available to assist you during your scheduled lab sections (also called closed labs) and by holding additional help hours outside of sections (also called open-labs). The closed-labs are only available to students registered for that lab section on GOLD. The open-labs are available to all students registered in the course (similar to office hours).

### Cameron King
* Email: csking@ucsb.edu

Hi all, I'm Cameron, a 4th year CS major. I've taken all the lower division courses here at UCSB including this class, and I hope to use that experience to help your learning this quarter. Feel free to discuss topics with me that are unrelated to this class, such as major course selection or internships in the software industry. When I'm not working, I enjoy nerd things like k-pop, Genshin Impact, ricing my Linux partition, and going to the gym.
