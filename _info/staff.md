## Course instructor: Phill Conrad

* Email: Please use Campuswire rather than email for course related communication.  You can send private messages on Campuswire to either the entire course staff or directly to me. If you must email me using my email address (phtcon@ucsb.edu), please put `CS16` in the subject line, and know that there may be a delay in the response.

## Learning Assistants (LAs)
In addition to the instructor and TA, there will be some undergraduate Learning Assistants (LAs) in the course who are available to assist you during your scheduled lab sections (also called closed labs) and by holding additional help hours outside of sections (also called open-labs). The closed-labs are only available to students registered for that lab section on GOLD. The open-labs are available to all students registered in the course (similar to office hours).

## Learning Assistants in training (LAs in training)

There may also be a few LAs in training, students in course numbered CMPSC 100.  These students will be shadowing the instructor, TAs, and LAs during the first five weeks of the course to learn about teaching CS.  During the first five weeks of the course, they are not permitted to help (it is a union violation), only observe.  Please make them welcome, and respect their boundaries.  Starting in week 6, they will start getting paid, and will start helping with the course.

# CS 16 Staff Profiles

## Phill Conrad, Instructor

Phill Conrad is a Teaching Professor in the CS department at UC Santa
Barbara.  Prof. Conrad joined the CS department in 2007, after
previously teaching at both Temple University in Philadelphia, and the
University of Delaware, where he earned his Ph.D.  His current
research is in the area of Software Engineering Education, and focuses
on bridging the gap between academic coursework, and real-world
software engineering practices.

## Nawel Alioua, TA

Hi everyone! My name is Nawel, and I am a first year Ph.D. student in the CS department at UCSB. I graduated with an Engineering/Master's degree from the National School of Computer Science in my hometown of Algiers - Algeria. I then moved to Japan to pursue my second Master's at the University of Tokyo, before joining Hitachi, Ltd. as a researcher.  During the 5 years I spent in the corporate world, I had the chance to work on very different projects, ranging from networking protocol development, to renewable energy systems design. That's our privilege as computer scientists: wherever there is some sort of computation/data involved (which in this day and age is everywhere!), we can have a role to play, and a contribution to make. For my Ph.D. I am planning to focus on networking technologies, as I believe efficient and reliable communication is the lifeline of modern societies. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to know more about any of the above themes, and of course, about C++ development. I'm excited to be part of the CS 16 staff, and I look forward to working with you all!

## Satyam Awasthi, TA

## Kevin Heffernan, TA

<img src="https://ucsb-cs16.github.io/f21/info/staff/CS16-F21-Kev.JPG" alt="Kev" width="150px" style="float: left; margin: 5px 10px 10px 10px;">

My name is Kevin, but call me Kev. I am a Master of Technology Management student who recently studied my undergraduate in CS at UCSB. I also recently worked at Appfolio as a Software Quality Assurance Engineer before returning to UCSB. 

I love to chat. Please come to me with any questions about homework, labs, or career planning. I would be happy to help you along.

My hobbies include dancing, singing, beach volleyball, and spending with with the people I love. 


## Lucas Relic, TA

Hi! My name is Lucas (he/him/his) and I am a 5th year BS/MS student studying computer science. I took this course 4 years ago and I know how daunting learning a new language (or programming for the first time) can seem. However, my goal is to break down difficult concepts and get everyone comfortable with C++ and C++ development. Future classes will build upon these fundamental topics so it's important to get a good grip on them now, and I can't reiterate enough how important it is to ask for help! Supportive teaching staff really enabled me to succeed in CS 16 and I hope to provide the same experience to all of you.

My research interest lies where computer vision and machine learning meet, as well as other deep learning applications. Additionally, my undergrad degree here was in Computer Engineering, and I've taken a wide variety of CS and ECE courses. Stop by my office hours if you'd like to ask any questions about my research, classes, or anything UCSB in general! I've been around campus for a while, so I might have some good information for you.

In my free time, I like to ski, ride bikes, and play video games. I look forward to getting to know all of you!

## April Sanchez, TA

April (she/her/hers) is a B.S/M.S student in the CS Department at UC Santa Barbara. April graduated with her B.S in CS in June 2021 and is currently completing her M.S.

As an Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP) student, April did HCI research in UCSB's Four Eyes Lab, but her current research interests are in Operating Systems and Distributed Systems. April has also intered at Google as a Software Engineering Intern for the past three summers. In her free time, April enjoys baking and going to the gym.


## Ashley Wang, TA

Hey everyone! My name is Ashley (she/her/hers) and I'm currently a 5th year in the BS/MS program. I'm super excited to be TA-ing for this class and to help you get a better understanding of any fundamental C++ topics. I also did my undergrad here at UCSB, so if you have any questions about specific classes or my undergrad experience in general, feel free to reach out or swing by office hours. If you ever have any questions, the best way to contact me will be through Campuswire through DM, and I'll try to get back to you within 24 hours. I'm really looking forward to meeting y'all and getting to know you throughout the rest of the quarter!

## Sydney Lim, LA in training

Hello everyone! My name is Sydney, and I'm a fourth-year CE major in the 5-year BS/MS program in CS. CMPSC 16 was the first CS course I took at UCSB. I remember the struggles that I faced as a first-year learning C++ for the first time, so I hope to help you guys get a strong foundation in this class in preparation for later courses. This is my first quarter being a ULA, so I'll be observing for the first half of the quarter. I look forward to helping out in sections and holding office hours in the second half! 

Feel free to talk to me about classes in the CMPSC/ECE department, GE recommendations, or general college advice. I also play regularly for UCSB Badminton, so if you're interested, you can probably find me in the Pavilion Gym on the weekends!

## Arthur Phan, LA in training.

Hey all! I'm the second Arthur for this course! My pronouns are he/him and I am a 5th year finishing my CS degree this Fall quarter! I'm looking forward to helping out as you'll be learning C++, CSIL, and Github for the first time, as well as all the theoretical concepts that will be fundamental to your CS courses here at UCSB!
