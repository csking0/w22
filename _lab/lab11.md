As announced in lecture, there is a "lab11" grade, which counts the same as the other labs, but is JUST a participation grade for filling out a survey.

The link is here: [lab11 survey](https://ucsb.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0qVnEcqYnx9AJkV)

Your responses are anonymous, but at the end of the survey you are redirected to a separate (unlinked) survey where you can enter your name and perm so that you can get credit for completing the assignment.

The survey is used to help us determine how to continuously improve the CS16/24/32 curriculum.  This is a multiple year project and the feedback we get from you is really valuable.

Please complete this survey by noon on Monday Dec 6.
